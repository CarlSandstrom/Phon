Reading a mesh
--------------

Currently, only reading from mesh files generated by `Neper`_ and exported to the .inp format is supported. This is done
as follows. First the read function is imported and executed::

    >>> from phon.io.read.read_from_neper_inp import read_from_neper_inp
    >>> mesh = read_from_neper_inp("n10-id1.inp")

The mesh is now stored into a :class:`phon.mesh_objects.mesh()` object. We can now query this object
for information about the mesh. A few example follows here:

* The number of elements in the mesh::

    >>> print len(mesh.elements)
    1683


* The number of nodes in the mesh::

    >>> print len(mesh.nodes)
    289

* The identifier of elements with a certain type::

    >>> print mesh.element_indices["C3D4"]
    [685, 686, 687, 688, ...]

* A node set with a certain name::

    >>> print mesh.node_sets["x0y0"]
    Node set with name x0y0 containing nodes with the following ids [1, 3, 34, 39, 40, 131, 132]

* Information about a specific node::

    >>> print mesh.nodes[10]
    Node located at (0.722422, 0.420036, 0.196344):

* Information about a specific element::

    >>> print mesh.elements[701]
    Element of type C3D4 containing the vertices with id [168, 150, 154, 60].
